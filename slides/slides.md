+ Not just **happen** to be Chr who exp loneliness
+ But natural **conseq** of growing in faith is seasons of
  + feeling **adrift**, w/o guidance / mentorship
  + feeling **isolated** when under attack
  + feeling **forgotten** and unloved
+ This often **happens** as we follow in footsteps of 
  + Chr, the man of **sorrows**
+ Take comfort in His **presence** 
  + as we open up **Word** of God
  + to behold the **Lamb** of God
______
+ Your Word promises 
  + You are near to the **brokenhearted**
+ We **present** our hearts + lives before You
+ Show us where we have wandered **astray**
+ Guide us back **home** again to You our Creator
+ In fellowship with **believers** worldwide
+ To proclaim Your **Name** until the day of Your **return**
