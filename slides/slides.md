## Orphaned but not Unloved

---
And we also thank God constantly for this, <br>
that when you received the word of God, <br>
which you heard from us, 

you accepted it not as the word of men<br>
but as what it really is, the word of God, <br>
which is at work in you believers. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
For you, brothers, became imitators <br>
of the churches of God in Christ Jesus <br>
that are in Judea. 

For you suffered the same things <br>
from your own countrymen <br>
as they did from the Jews,

[1 Thessalonians 2:14 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
who killed both <br>
the Lord Jesus and the prophets, <br>
and drove us out, <br>
and displease God <br>
and oppose all mankind <br>
[16](# "ref")
by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles <br>
that they might be saved —

[1 Thessalonians 2:15-16 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
so as always to fill up <br>
the measure of their sins. <br>
But wrath has come upon them at last!

[1 Thessalonians 2:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
But since we were torn away from you, <br>
brothers, for a short time, <br>
in person not in heart, 

we endeavored the more eagerly and with <br>
great desire to see you face to face, <br>
[18](# "ref")
because we wanted to come to you — <br>
I, Paul, again and again — <br>
but Satan hindered us. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:17-18 (ESV)](# "ref")

For what is our hope or joy <br>
or crown of boasting <br>
before our Lord Jesus at his coming? <br>
Is it not you? <br>
[20](# "ref")
For you are our glory and joy.

[1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 (ESV)](# "ref")
