# Orphaned <br> but not Unloved
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

## 1 Thessalonians 2:13-20

>>>
+ **Hard** to continue **growing** as Chr
  + **easy** to **slow** down, stop, even backslide
+ Can be **lonely** path to walk
+ In **walk** w/Chr, **all** of us exp loneliness
  + even amidst supportive **friends**, 
  + wonderful **family**, happy **marriage**

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# How should I handle <br> **loneliness** in my <br> Christian walk?
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Not just **happen** to be Chr who exp loneliness
+ But natural **conseq** of growing in faith is seasons of
  + feeling **adrift**, w/o guidance / mentorship
  + feeling **isolated** when under attack
  + feeling **forgotten** and unloved
+ This often **happens** as we follow in footsteps of 
  + Chr, the man of **sorrows**
+ Take comfort in His **presence** 
  + as we open up **Word** of God
  + to behold the **Lamb** of God

---
## (prayer)
>>>
+ Your Word promises 
  + You are near to the **brokenhearted**
+ We **present** our hearts + lives before You
+ Show us where we have wandered **astray**
+ Guide us back **home** again to You our Creator
+ In fellowship with **believers** worldwide
+ To proclaim Your **Name** until the day of Your **return**

## Orphaned but not Unloved

When we feel:
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 1.6em" -->

1. **Directionless** [(v13)](# "ref")
1. **Attacked** [(v14-16)](# "ref")
1. **Forgotten** [(v17-20)](# "ref")

<!-- .element: style="font-size: 1.6em" -->

>>>
+ Looking for **wisdom**, guidance, mentorship: find none
+ Proclaim **gospel** causes **loved** ones to turn against us
  + **Hurt** deeply by **peer** group bc name of Jesus
+ Feel **forgotten** by those who claimed to **love** us in God
+ Pay **attention** to how Paul **comforts** Thess:
  + and receive **encouragement**:

---
And we also thank God constantly for this, <br>
that when you **received** the word of God, <br>
which you heard from us, 

you **accepted** it not as the word of **men**<br>
but as what it really is, the word of **God**, <br>
which is at work in you believers. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Pastor/evangel: preach **Word** vs speak as **indiv**
  + pers **opinion**, advice from **exp**: word of **man**
+ But when share from **Scrip**, to extent holds **closely**:
  + Word of **God**: authority
  + Belongs to **God**, heard from **us**, taken up by **you**
+ "But **pastor** said its ok" (or **Sean**): don't want **resp**!
+ **Ident**: not denom, polit affil, famous preacher
  + but as disciple of **Christ**
+ Each of us **accountable** before God for own actions
  + I have **no** auth in self: only **Word** does
+ e.g., teaching little kids what not to **eat**
+ James 1 has **promise** for each:

---

But one who has **looked intently** <br>
at the perfect law, the **law of freedom**, 

and has continued in it, not having become <br>
a **forgetful hearer** but an **active doer**, 

this person will be blessed in what he does.

[James 1:25 (NASB)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "look intently": bend over / **stoop down**
  + inspect, **curious**
+ **self-motivated**: not that God is **obtuse**, 
  + but I need to **study** Scrip more deeply
+ Not mere **acad** interest (Bible trivia),
  + but aim to **obey**: put **faith** into **action**
+ Be **honest** w/self:

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# What is my <br> **attitude** towards <br> God's **Word**?
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Answer not to impress **pastor** / **friends**
  + but for **self** + **God** who is at **work** in me
  + **empowering** me to be active **doer**
+ S.times: could **care** less: **irrel**, diff **culture** / age
+ Or when **tired** / stressed: flip through for **comfort**
  + but **encour** passages (like 1Thes!) seem **empty**
+ Then get **angry** @God: are You so **naive** / blind
  + to **real** pain / injustice suffered by **me** + others?
+ Issue is not that Bible doesn't deal **head-on** w/sin
  + but I don't want to **read** those passages
  + for fear of having to confront my **own** sin
+ What is my **attitude** towards God's Word?

## Orphaned but not Unloved

When we feel:
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 1.6em" -->

1. Directionless [(v13)](# "ref")
1. **Attacked** [(v14-16)](# "ref")
1. Forgotten [(v17-20)](# "ref")

<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ When I feel **directionless** without a mentor:
  + **Dive** into Scrip, **seek** out others w/same mindset
+ When I feel **attacked** bc of name of Jesus:
  + Know that I'm not **alone** in suffering:

---
For you, brothers, became **imitators** <br>
of the **churches** of God in Christ Jesus <br>
that are in Judea. 

For you **suffered** the same things <br>
from your own **countrymen** <br>
as they did from the Jews,

[1 Thessalonians 2:14 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ This suff is conseq of **repent**, of
  + walking **worthy** of God who calls (v12):
+ Implicitly reveals **world** chases / **values** / prides is
  + in wrong **dir**: so naturally, most will take **offense**.
+ Now, if I **sin** + endure suffer for it: not to my **credit**.
  + But if I endure suffering for doing **good**,
  + then I experience God's **grace**.
+ Not **seek out** martyrdom, certainly not for own **glory**:
  + "imitators": **mimic**, copy: similar, not necc. **goal**
+ Simlarity is: **countrymen** / tribe / family / peers
  + felt we **betrayed** them, so they:

---
who killed both <br>
the Lord **Jesus** and the **prophets**, <br>
and drove **us** out, <br>
and displease **God** <br>
and oppose all **mankind** <br>
by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles <br>
that they might be saved —

[1 Thessalonians 2:15-16 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Regarding **Christ** + prophets: killed
  + **us** (Paul, Tim): persecute / pursue
  + **God**: not (desiring to) pleasing
  + **people** (any who preach gospel): stand opposed
+ We ought not to be **surprised** by persecution;
  + Christ reminded His **disciples**:

---
If they **persecuted** me, <br>
they will also persecute you. <br>
If they **kept my word**, they will also keep yours. 

[21](# "ref")
But all these things they will do to you <br>
on account of **my name**, <br>
because they do not know him who **sent** me.

[John 15:20-21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ If we **look** like Chr, **act** as He did,
  + world will **oppose** us as it did Chr.
+ But our concern is not to prove others **wrong**
  + but simply to **abide** in Chr: branch in **vine**
+ End **result** for those who **oppose** gospel:

---
so as always to **fill up** <br>
the measure of their **sins**. <br>
But **wrath** has come upon them at last!

[1 Thessalonians 2:16b (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Accum more + more **sin**
  + God's wrath already **begun** (reached)
  + "at last": to **end** / utmost / complete: thorough
+ Notably absent: **revenge**: God is **just** + judge,
  + doesn't need our **help** to judge
+ As for those **opposed** to Christ: **hope** for repent,
  + but **persevere** in proclaiming gospel:
+ You don't need to **wait** for loved ones to believe
  + before **continuing** to share with others
+ When feel **isolated** by those who **misund** + mock
  + for following in Christ's **footsteps**:
+ Remember we are not **alone** in suffering for Christ

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# **Who** else has <br> endured **suffering** <br> for the gospel?
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Take **courage** from **prophets** of old:
  + "Hall of **faith**" in Heb 11, 
  + early church **fathers**,
  + **missionaries** of prev centuries,
+ Those now **still** being persecuted for Christ;
  + even though don't **see** them regularly:
+ Fighting on another **hilltop** in same conflict
  + not against **flesh** + blood but **Satan's** schemes 
+ Who else has endured **suffering** for sake of gospel?

1. **Forgotten** [(v17-20)](# "ref")

<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ **Expect** gospel to encounter **opposition**
  + that **sin** might become utterly **sinful**.
+ Be encouraged that you are not **alone**
  + in **suffering** for the name of Jesus.
+ But bc don't get to **see** those coworkers in Chr
  + often feel **forgotten** by them
  + as though they don't **care**: v17

---
But since we were **torn away** from you, <br>
brothers, for a **short** time, <br>
in **person** not in **heart**, 

[1 Thessalonians 2:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "torn away": **orphaned**, separated
+ Spent maybe **3 weeks** in Thess:
  + preach **gospel**, est **church**, then **left**
+ Thess: "why haven't you **returned**? Do you **care**?"
  + Similar themes in **Cor**, **Phil**, etc.
  + Felt **orphaned**, w/o pastor / **leader**
+ But actually it was **Paul** who felt orphaned!
  + "in person" (**face** to face), not in **heart**
+ Only for "short time": an **hour**'s time: will pass

---
we endeavored the more **eagerly** and with <br>
great desire to see you face to face, <br>
[18](# "ref")
because we wanted to come to you — <br>
I, Paul, **again and again** — <br>
but **Satan** hindered us. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:17-18 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ had "great desire": **heat**, passion in hearts
+ desired "more eagerly": **quickness** / run to see you
  + not **reluctantly** out of obligation
+ and "wanted": made actual **plans**
+ "again and again": **once** and **twice** [(+)](https://koine-greek.com/2012/07/25/once-and-twice-the-countability-of-events/)
  + **tried** to come: specific, repeated instances
+ **Opposition** to gospel not only by **people**
  + but even **supernatural** forces
+ Paul **comforts** Thess: not don't **care** about you,
  + Of **course** desire eagerly to visit you! **Why**?
+ bc **this** is what you **mean** to us:

---
For what is our **hope** or **joy** <br>
or **crown** of boasting <br>
before our Lord Jesus at his coming?

Is it not you? <br>
For you are our **glory** and **joy**.

[1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ We who **toil** in love for sake of name of Chr
  + rcv very little **glory** / thx / reward in this life
+ But when Christ **returns** in glory?
  + then our **trust** in Him will be **vindicated**
+ **Fruit** of labour is see God's **handiwork** in your lives:
  + **hope**, **joy**, **glory** / crown of boasting
  + not in **own** achievement, but work of **HS**
+ You (your **progress** in faith) **matter** to God
  + and to **others** who have spoken His Word to you

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Why should we continue <br> **growing** in faith in Christ?
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ So easy to **give up**, stop growing, stay stagnant
  + try **decent** pers, don't **push** to know Chr more.
+ **Others** do this, and seem **happy**, content, success:
+ Why do I have to **work** at it? **Study** Bible intently,
  + strive for pers **holiness**, taking **cross** daily,
+ Persev in **serving** + **proclaiming** gospel to those
  + who take **offense** + call me a **traitor**?
+ Is it **worth** it?  Don't **give up** hope!
+ Your progress + **maturity** in faith brings **glory** to God.
+ You are being **cheered** on by cloud of many **witnesses**
  + for whom **you** are their hope / joy / glory.
+ Why should we cont **growing** deeper in faith in Chr?

---
## (prayer)
>>>
+ When **directionless**: **delight** in Word + humbly **obey**.
+ When **hurt** by those who oppose You:
  + **persevere** in sharing gospel in **love**,
  + not **alone**, many others suffering for name of Jesus.
+ When feel **forgotten** by everyone:
  + proven **faith** in You is more precious 
  + than **gold** which perishes in fire.
+ Forgive us for neglecting to **nurture** our trust in You
  + Bring us **home** again in Your arms
  + Breathe in us to **live** again in Your life
  + Energise to **proclaim** Word w/all boldness
+ To **praise**, honour, glory of name of Chr at Your return
